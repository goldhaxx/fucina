  purpose: Comprehensive strategic project briefing — synthesize git activity, active spec, completed specs, untriaged ideas, backlog state, roadmap themes, and current substrate posture into a structured macro-view (Shipped / In Flight / Up Next / Horizon). Connects tactical session work to strategic direction across all time horizons.

Scan the project's current state across all time horizons and produce a strategic briefing.

## Data gathering (deterministic)

1. Run: `bash .ccanvil/scripts/docs-check.sh radar-gather`
2. Run: `bash .ccanvil/scripts/operations.sh exec backlog.list` (if available — gracefully skip if not). On Linear-routed projects this hits the http resolver (BTS-175) and returns the canonical Backlog-state items.

  **Do NOT use `idea.list` here** (BTS-175). `idea.list` filters by `label=idea` and silently hides scaffold-labeled tickets — using it as a backlog proxy produces phantom "no work left" reports while real tickets sit in Backlog. `backlog.list` is the canonical "what's left to ship" surface.
3. Read `docs/roadmap.md` (if it exists)

## Briefing (synthesis)

Using the gathered data, produce a structured briefing with these sections:

### Shipped
Recently completed features (from `completed_recent`). For each, one line: what it was and which roadmap goal it served. If no roadmap exists, just list completions.

### In Flight
Current work: active spec name, branch, what's being built, estimated progress based on git activity. If no active spec, say so.

### Up Next
The next 2-3 priorities. Source from: roadmap "Up Next" section, Ready specs in backlog, or untriaged ideas that align with the active theme. Recommend what to start after current work completes.

### Horizon
Longer-term items from roadmap "Horizon" section and backlog tickets that aren't immediately actionable. Brief — just names and one-line context.

### Ideas
If there are untriaged ideas (ideas.new > 0), list them and note any that connect to current themes. Suggest running `/idea triage` if count > 3.

If `ideas.icebox_stale_count > 0`, surface it as an ambient re-evaluation nudge: "N icebox items older than 60 days — run `/idea review-icebox`." When the count is 0, stay silent (no noise).

### Health
- Context budget status (run `bash .ccanvil/scripts/context-budget.sh check --text` if available)
- Test count trend (if known from recent commits)
- Theme drift: does current work align with the roadmap's active theme? If not, flag it.

## Close with a recommendation

End with ONE clear recommended action:
- If in the middle of a feature: "Continue current work on <feature>."
- If between features: "Start <next priority> — run `docs-check.sh activate <id>`."
- If ideas are piling up: "Triage ideas first — run `/idea triage`."
- If roadmap is stale or missing: "Update `docs/roadmap.md` to reflect current direction."

## Rules

- `/radar` is read-only. It never modifies files, creates commits, or starts work.
- Keep the briefing concise — aim for one screen of output.
- If data is missing (no roadmap, no ideas, no backlog), adapt gracefully — show what's available.
