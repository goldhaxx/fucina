  purpose: Create an implementation plan for the active feature — reads the spec via the BTS-204 provider-aware artifact-read primitive, analyzes affected files for existing patterns, and writes a step-by-step plan to docs/plan.md sized for ~5–15min TDD cycles per step. BTS-20 lifecycle pre-flight gates entry to spec-activated / plan-written states only.

Create an implementation plan for the feature described in the user's message (or in `docs/spec.md` if no message provided).

## Steps

0. **BTS-20: lifecycle-state pre-flight.** Run `bash .ccanvil/scripts/docs-check.sh lifecycle-state --project-dir .` and read `.state`. /plan is legal only when state is `spec-activated` (drafting first plan) or `plan-written` (re-planning after spec edit). On any other state — `no-active-spec`, `session-wrap`, `blocked`, `uninitialized` — STOP with the envelope's `.blockers[]` (when populated) or a clear message naming the current state and the legal entry conditions. This fails fast instead of /plan reading `docs/spec.md` silently and erroring late on missing content.
1. Read `.ccanvil/templates/plan.md` for the plan format guide.
2. **Read the active spec via the provider-aware primitive (BTS-204).** Run
   `bash .ccanvil/scripts/docs-check.sh artifact-read --kind spec --feature <FEATURE_ID>`.
   On local-routed nodes this reads `docs/spec.md`; on Linear-routed nodes
   (`integrations.routing.spec=linear`) this reads the Linear Document.
   Use the active feature id (from branch name `claude/<type>/<feature-id>` or
   from the spec's `> Work:` metadata) as `<FEATURE_ID>` — pass `BTS-N` for
   Linear-routed projects.
3. Extract the `feature_id` from the spec's metadata (the `> Feature:` line) read in Step 2.
4. Compute the spec's content hash: run `.ccanvil/scripts/docs-check.sh status` and read `.spec.content_hash` from the JSON output. (Local-routed only — Linear-routed plans store their own hash via the Linear Document update flow; see BTS-204 plan for follow-up substrate.)
5. Analyze the codebase to identify affected files and existing patterns.
6. **Write the plan via the provider-aware primitive (BTS-204).** Compose
   the full plan content (with metadata header), then pipe it to:
   `bash .ccanvil/scripts/docs-check.sh artifact-write --kind plan --feature <FEATURE_ID>`.
   On local-routed nodes this writes `docs/plan.md`; on Linear-routed nodes
   this upserts the plan Linear Document parented to the feature's issue.
   Metadata header must include:
   - `> Feature: <feature_id>` (copied from spec)
   - `> Created: <epoch>` (using `date +%s`)
   - `> Spec hash: <hash>` (from step 4)
5. Each step should be small enough to complete in one TDD cycle (~5-15 minutes).
6. Order steps so each builds on the previous — earlier steps establish foundations, later steps add features.

6a. **Live-API validation gate (BTS-171).** If any plan step flags a live-API contract uncertainty — phrasings like `live API`, `live endpoint`, `exact filter shape`, `may not work`, `if the live API rejects`, `verify against live`, or equivalent — explicitly enumerate the live command that proves the contract and require its execution BEFORE the implementation step is considered complete (i.e., before commit and before `/review`). Stubs accept any shape; only live calls verify contract. See `.claude/rules/tdd.md#live-api-validation-gate` for the rule and prior incidents (BTS-115, BTS-170).

7. If any step adds, removes, or modifies preset infrastructure (commands, rules, agents, skills, hooks, scripts, or sync behavior), add a final step to update documentation. Read these files only when this step applies:
   - **Hub-wide changes** (modifying hub-shared files): update the relevant file in `.ccanvil/guide/` (hub section, above `<!-- NODE-SPECIFIC-START -->`). If conventions or "do not" rules changed, update the hub section of `CLAUDE.md` (below `<!-- HUB-MANAGED-START -->`).
   - **Local-only changes** (adding project-specific commands, rules, agents): update the node-specific section of the relevant `.ccanvil/guide/` file (below `<!-- NODE-SPECIFIC-START -->`). If the project's tech stack, commands, or architecture changed, update the node section of `CLAUDE.md` (above `<!-- HUB-MANAGED-START -->`).

Do NOT implement anything. Plan only.
