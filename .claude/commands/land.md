  purpose: Post-merge step that wraps `docs-check.sh land` (git mechanics — fast-forward main, delete branch, recover landed branch via squash-subject parse) and follows up by parsing the AUTO-CLOSE marker and dispatching the linked Linear ticket to Done via the BTS-128 ticket.transition primitive. Auto-close failure NEVER blocks the merge cleanup.

Return the working tree to main after a PR merge, then auto-close the linked Linear issue.

`/land` is the canonical post-merge step. It wraps `docs-check.sh land` (git mechanics) and follows up by dispatching the AUTO-CLOSE intent the script emits for the just-landed spec — transitioning the linked Linear issue to `Done` via the BTS-128 `ticket.transition` primitive. On MCP failure, the transition is queued to `.ccanvil/ideas-pending.log` for `/idea sync` to replay — auto-close NEVER blocks the merge cleanup.

## Steps

1. Run `bash .ccanvil/scripts/docs-check.sh land` and capture its stdout.
2. Grep the captured stdout for a line matching `^AUTO-CLOSE: `. If none, you're done — just print the script's output and exit.
3. If a marker line is present, extract the JSON payload (everything after `AUTO-CLOSE: `). Parse `provider`, `id`, and `role`.
4. If `provider != "linear"`: this should not happen (the script only emits the marker for `linear:`), but be defensive — log `auto-close: unexpected provider '<p>' — skipping` and exit 0 without dispatching.
5. Resolve the transition intent:
   ```bash
   RESOLUTION=$(bash .ccanvil/scripts/operations.sh resolve ticket.transition <id> <role> --project-dir .)
   ```
   BTS-164 migrated `ticket.transition` to `mechanism: http` — the resolver returns `.invocation.command` containing a complete `linear-query.sh save-issue` invocation (no MCP indirection).
6. Dispatch by eval'ing the resolved command:
   ```bash
   eval "$(echo "$RESOLUTION" | jq -r '.invocation.command')"
   ```
7. **On success:** echo `Auto-closed <id> → Done`. Done.
8. **On failure** (network/auth/server error, exit non-zero): enqueue a pending entry deterministically:
   ```bash
   bash .ccanvil/scripts/docs-check.sh idea-pending-append \
     --op ticket.transition --id <id> --role <role>
   ```
   Echo `PENDING: auto-close queued for /idea sync`. Exit 0 — auto-close failure NEVER blocks the post-merge cleanup.

## Idempotency

If the Linear issue is already in `Done` (e.g. manually transitioned, or replayed from an earlier pending-log entry), Linear's `issueUpdate` mutation accepts the transition without error. No duplicate handling needed on the client side.

## Rules

- `/land` is the post-merge canonical flow. Users who run `docs-check.sh land` directly bypass the dispatch — the `AUTO-CLOSE: {...}` marker prints on stdout, but nothing parses it, nothing writes to the pending log, and nothing transitions the issue. In that case the Linear issue stays open and must be closed manually (via `/idea triage`, direct `ticket.transition <id> done`, or the Linear UI).
- `/land` NEVER fails the land step because of Linear errors — the pending-log fallback guarantees forward progress.
- When no AUTO-CLOSE marker is emitted (legacy spec, local provider, non-claude branch, etc.), `/land` is a transparent passthrough over `docs-check.sh land`.
- **Known gap:** if the user has already switched to main (e.g. after `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch` which switches + deletes in one step) before invoking `/land`, `cmd_land`'s "already on main" early-return path runs the fast-forward but skips the branch-regex safety net, so no AUTO-CLOSE marker is emitted and no auto-close fires. Workaround: run `/land` from the feature branch BEFORE `gh pr merge` switches you to main. A future ship can add squash-commit-subject parsing to recover the feature-id on the already-on-main path.
