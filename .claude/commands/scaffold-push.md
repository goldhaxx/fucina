Push project customizations to the scaffold hub for review.

All deterministic operations (copy, hash, lockfile, git commit, logging) are handled by the script. Claude's role is LIMITED to: classifying changes as generalizable vs project-specific.

## Step 1: Pre-check and identify candidates (deterministic)

```bash
./scripts/scaffold-sync.sh pre-check
./scripts/scaffold-sync.sh push-candidates
```

If the user specified a file: `./scripts/scaffold-sync.sh push-candidates <file>`

Read the JSON output: array of `{file, status, has_diff}` objects.

## Step 2: For each candidate (JUDGMENT CALL)

1. Read the file content.
2. If `has_diff` is true, show the diff: `./scripts/scaffold-sync.sh diff <file>`
3. **Classify the change** — this is Claude's judgment call:
   - **Generalizable** — useful across projects (new rule, improved workflow, better agent prompt, utility script)
   - **Project-specific** — references project names, specific APIs, domain logic, tech stack details
   - **Mixed** — extract generalizable parts
4. Present the classification and rationale to the user.
5. User approves, skips, or edits.

## Step 3: Apply approved pushes (deterministic)

For each approved file:
```bash
./scripts/scaffold-sync.sh push-apply <file> "<brief description>"
```

For mixed files where only parts are generalizable: read the scaffold version, apply only the generalizable changes to a temp file, show the user for approval, then push the temp file content.

## Step 4: Finalize (deterministic)

```bash
./scripts/scaffold-sync.sh push-finalize "chore(scaffold): upstream <description>"
```

Report what was pushed.

## Rules
- NEVER run `cp`, `jq`, `lock-update`, or `git -C` manually. Use compound commands.
- NEVER push project-specific content (tech stack, project names, API endpoints, domain logic).
- NEVER push the CLAUDE.md node section (above the delimiter).
- ALWAYS show the user what will be written to the scaffold before committing.
