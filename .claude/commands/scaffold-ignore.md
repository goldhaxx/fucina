Mark a scaffold-tracked file as node-only, permanently excluding it from sync.

Use when a file is intentionally project-specific and should never be pulled, pushed, or shown as a conflict again.

This is a fully deterministic operation. No Claude judgment needed.

## Steps

1. The user provides a file path as an argument: `/scaffold-ignore .claude/rules/sketches.md`

2. Confirm with the user: "This will mark `<file>` as node-only. It will be permanently excluded from `/scaffold-pull` and `/scaffold-push`. You can undo this with `./scripts/scaffold-sync.sh track <file>`. Proceed?"

3. **(DETERMINISTIC)** Run:
```bash
./scripts/scaffold-sync.sh node-only <file>
```

4. Report the result.

## Rules
- If the file is not in the lockfile, the script will error with a clear message.
- If the file is already node-only, the script will skip with a message.
