# Test-Driven Development

**Red-Green-Refactor cycle:** write ONE failing test → minimum code to pass → refactor with all green → repeat. One acceptance criterion at a time.

**Live-API gate:** when a plan step flags contract uncertainty (phrasings like *"if the live API rejects"*, *"verify against live"*, *"exact filter shape may not work"*), run ONE live call against the risky endpoint and confirm success BEFORE committing AND BEFORE `/review`. Stubs accept any shape; only live verifies contract. Doesn't apply to pure-prose, gitignore, or doc-only diffs.

**When tests break after a change:** the change is wrong, not the tests. Fix implementation, not the test — unless the spec changed (then update test FIRST, confirm fail, then update implementation).

For the expanded R-G-R rationale, BTS-115/170 incident detail, test-structure conventions, what-to-test heuristic, hooks-integration mechanism, strict-mode-bats discipline (BTS-127), `bats-report.sh` tooling reference (BTS-118/137), and test-execution discipline (BTS-383): see evidence anchor `docs/research/tdd-foundations.md`.
