# Workflow and Context Management Rules

## Session Discipline

- Each session has ONE objective. State it explicitly at the start.
- After completing the objective, commit and suggest `/clear` for the next task.
- If a session exceeds ~30 minutes of complex work, proactively suggest checkpointing.

## Before Writing Code

1. Search the codebase first: use grep/glob to find relevant patterns before reading files.
2. Read only the 3-5 most relevant files. Do not dump entire directories into context.
3. Check for existing tests that cover the area you're modifying.
4. If the task is ambiguous, ask one clarifying question before proceeding.

## Context Preservation

- When I say "checkpoint," write to `docs/checkpoint.md` (see `docs/templates/checkpoint.md` for format):
  - What was accomplished this session
  - Current state of the implementation
  - Failing tests (if any) and why
  - Exact next steps to resume
- When resuming after `/clear`, read `docs/checkpoint.md` first.

## Commit Practices

- Commit after each passing test cycle (red → green → refactor → commit).
- Message format: `type(scope): description` — e.g., `feat(auth): add JWT refresh token rotation`
- Types: feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, chore, perf
- Never commit with failing tests.

## Delegation

- Use sub-agents for: researching unfamiliar APIs, reading large files, exploring codebase structure.
- Keep the main session for: implementation decisions, writing code, running tests.
- When spawning a sub-agent, give it a specific question to answer, not an open-ended exploration.

## Scaffold Sync

- After adding a new rule, command, agent, or skill, consider whether it's project-specific or globally useful.
- Run `/scaffold-status` periodically to check for scaffold updates.
- Before starting a new project, pull latest scaffold changes into your current project first.

## Error Recovery

- After 2 failed attempts at the same approach, STOP.
- Write what you've learned to `docs/checkpoint.md`.
- Suggest: "This approach isn't working. Let me outline alternatives."
- Do not keep trying variations of a failing strategy.
