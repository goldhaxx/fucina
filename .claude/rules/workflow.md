  purpose: Codify the canonical feature lifecycle (Spec → Activate → Plan → Implement → Complete → Merge → Land), session discipline (one objective per session; end-of-session ritual /stasis → /compact), strategic-awareness primitives (/radar, /idea, docs/roadmap.md), context-preservation rules (stasis before compact; /recall after reset), hub-sync classification, and error-recovery protocol (after 2 failed attempts, STOP and capture state).
  input:
    - "read-only: rule consumed across the full lifecycle (spec, activate, plan, implement, complete, ship, land, stasis, recall)"
  output:
    - "behavior-shape: forces session-discipline rituals; halts long unsubmitted work; routes recovery through stasis"

# Workflow

**Feature lifecycle:** Spec → Activate → Plan → Implement → Complete → Merge → Land. Main is protected (PreToolUse hook blocks direct commits).

**Session discipline:** one objective per session. End with summary → next-action → `/stasis` → `/compact`. Resume after reset via `/recall`. Determinism review is mandatory in every stasis — see `self-review.md`.

**Error recovery:** after 2 failed attempts, STOP. Run `/stasis` and surface alternatives instead of looping.

For the full lifecycle table, per-phase commands, strategic-awareness primitives, context-preservation detail, hub-sync classification, and reasoning behind each rule: see the evidence anchor `docs/research/feature-lifecycle.md`.
