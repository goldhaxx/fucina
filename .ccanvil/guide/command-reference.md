## Session Management Commands

| Command | When | What it does |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `/recall` | After `/compact` or `/clear` | Reads `docs/stasis.md` + git state, reports status |
| `/stasis` | End of session, before `/compact` | Strategic review — writes state + determinism/security/cross-session review to `docs/stasis.md`, commits |
| `/compact` | Between tasks | Compresses context, retains summary (built-in) |
| `/clear` | Full reset (rare) | Resets context entirely (built-in) |
| `/compact` | Context heavy | Summarizes context to free space (built-in) |
| `/cost` | Monitoring | Shows token usage (built-in) |

## Sync Commands

| Command | Direction | What it does |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| `/ccanvil-status` | Read-only | Shows sync state of all tracked files |
| `/ccanvil-pull` | Hub → Project | Pulls updates, resolves conflicts |
| `/ccanvil-push` | Project → Hub | Pushes generalizable changes upstream |
| `/ccanvil-promote <file>` | Project → Hub | Promotes a local file to the hub |
| `/ccanvil-demote <file>` | Local | Marks a hub file as local override |
| `/ccanvil-ignore <file>` | Local | Marks file as node-only (permanently excluded from sync) |
| `ccanvil-sync.sh broadcast [--dry-run]` | Hub → All nodes | Pushes auto-updates to all registered nodes in one pass |

## Utility Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ccanvil-audit` | Analyzes configuration for stochastic-to-deterministic improvement opportunities. Calls `manifest-check.sh check` for deterministic README verification. Includes permissions audit and context budget check. |
| `/fix-certs` | Diagnoses and repairs Cloudflare WARP TLS certificate issues |
| `/ccanvil-init` | Initializes a new project from the ccanvil hub, or retrofits it onto an existing project. Mode-aware: detects one of five `project_mode` values (fresh, source-no-git, mature-repo, partial-ccanvil, already-initialized) and branches its behavior. Mature-repo mode preserves `CLAUDE.md`, git history, and in-progress lifecycle docs. |
| `ccanvil-sync.sh retrofit-check <hub>` | Read-only dry-run of `/ccanvil-init` — prints the detected mode and the per-file plan (File / Hub / Local / Action / Reason) without modifying anything. |

## Permissions Audit Scripts

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `permissions-audit.sh check [--settings-dir DIR] [--log FILE]` | Classify all Bash permission entries as DANGER/UNREVIEWED/REVIEWED → JSON |
| `permissions-audit.sh check --text [--verbose]` | Human-readable grouped report (DANGER, UNREVIEWED, optionally REVIEWED) |
| `permissions-audit.sh init [--settings-dir DIR] [--log FILE]` | Create/update decision log with stubs for unreviewed entries |

## Context Budget Scripts

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `context-budget.sh check` | Measure token cost of always-loaded configuration files → JSON |
| `context-budget.sh check --text` | Human-readable table with per-file tokens and budget status |
| `context-budget.sh check --model MODEL_ID` | Set context window from known model (e.g., `claude-opus-4-6[1m]` → 1M) |
| `context-budget.sh check --context-window N` | Set context window size directly (overrides `--model`) |
| `context-budget.sh check --budget N` | Override budget ceiling directly (overrides `--context-window` and `--model`) |

## Operations Routing Scripts

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `operations.sh resolve <operation> [--project-dir DIR]` | Resolve operation to provider/mechanism/invocation JSON based on `.claude/ccanvil.json` routing config. Returns local bash adapter when no config exists. |

## Registry & Node Identity

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `ccanvil-sync.sh register` | Register the current project in the hub. Generates a stable UUID at first run (stored in `.claude/ccanvil.local.json`, mirrored in lockfile). Registry is keyed by UUID; path stored in `~`-portable form |
| `ccanvil-sync.sh registry` | List all registered downstream projects with UUID, name, path, last-synced info |
| `ccanvil-sync.sh broadcast` | Iterate registered nodes by UUID (auto-migrates legacy path-keyed entries). Reports `STALE` when a UUID's path no longer exists |
| `ccanvil-sync.sh events [--event T] [--node N] [--since EPOCH]` | Print hub's audit log as newline-delimited JSON. Events: `register`, `broadcast_sync`, `migrate_legacy_keys`. Filter by type, node uuid/name, or minimum timestamp |

Node UUIDs make registration resilient to renames, moves, machine changes, and multi-user setups. The UUID is authoritative; paths self-update on each sync.

`register` and `broadcast` never commit to the hub repo. The registry (`.ccanvil/registry.json`) is gitignored machine-local state, and operational events are appended to `.ccanvil/events.log` (also gitignored). Use `ccanvil-sync.sh events` to query the audit trail. Bootstrap commits in nodes (for the node-side UUID file) still happen because `.claude/ccanvil.local.json` is intentionally tracked per-node.

## Global Commands Sync

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `ccanvil-sync.sh pull-globals [--force]` | Copy hub's `global-commands/ccanvil-*.md` to `~/.claude/commands/`. Conflict-safe: differing local files are reported with diffs, not overwritten. `--force` overwrites conflicts |
| `/ccanvil-pull-globals` | Skill wrapper — runs the script and summarizes results |

Only files matching `ccanvil-*.md` are hub-owned; all other files in `~/.claude/commands/` are user-owned and never touched by ccanvil. This keeps ccanvil as a bolt-on, not a replacement for your Claude Code setup.

## Multi-Spec Lifecycle Scripts

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `docs-check.sh list-specs [docs-dir]` | List all specs in `docs/specs/` with feature_id, status, created → JSON array |
| `docs-check.sh activate <feature-id> [docs-dir]` | Create branch `claude/<type>/<id>`, copy spec to `docs/spec.md`, set status to In Progress, push branch, create draft PR. Tolerates dirty `docs/specs/*`, `docs/spec.md`, `docs/ideas.md`, `docs/roadmap.md` |
| `docs-check.sh complete <feature-id> [docs-dir]` | Set spec status to Complete, remove lifecycle docs (spec/plan/stasis), commit cleanup, mark PR ready |
| `docs-check.sh land [--force]` | On feature branch: switch to main, fetch, reset to origin, delete local and remote branch. On main (post-`gh pr merge --delete-branch`): fetch and fast-forward to `origin/main`. `--force` skips PR-merged check |
| `docs-check.sh config-get <key> [project-dir]` | Read feature toggle from `.claude/ccanvil.json` (returns `true`/`false`) |

## Idea Management Scripts

The `/idea` skill routes captures through `operations.sh` based on the node's provider config (`integrations.routing.idea` in `.claude/ccanvil.local.json`). Default: gitignored `.ccanvil/ideas.log` (JSONL). Opt-in: Linear Triage via MCP. The scripts below back the local provider and expose the primitives the skill orchestrates for the Linear path. `/idea` never commits to git and never creates a branch.

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `docs-check.sh idea-add "<body>" [--title TITLE] [project-dir]` | Append a JSONL entry to `.ccanvil/ideas.log` (local provider). `--title` defaults to body when omitted (short-text fast path). |
| `docs-check.sh idea-list [--status <status>] [project-dir]` | List ideas as JSON array. Filter: `new`, `promoted`, `parked`, `dismissed`, `merged` |
| `docs-check.sh idea-count [project-dir]` | Count ideas by status → JSON `{total, new, promoted, parked, dismissed, merged}` |
| `docs-check.sh idea-update <uid> <status> [project-dir]` | Update an entry's status by UID |
| `docs-check.sh idea-sync [--ack <ts>] [project-dir]` | Without args → emit `{pending, entries}` from `.ccanvil/ideas-pending.log`. With `--ack <ts>` → remove the matching pending entry. Replay is driven by `/idea sync` (Linear MCP orchestration in the skill). |
| `docs-check.sh idea-migrate [--extract\|--finalize] [project-dir]` | Move legacy `docs/ideas.md` entries to `.ccanvil/ideas.log`, `git rm` the source, update `.gitignore`. `--extract` emits JSONL intents for skill-level Linear dispatch; `--finalize` does the filesystem cleanup alone. Idempotent. |
| `docs-check.sh idea-setup --provider local\|linear [--team TEAM --project PROJECT] [project-dir]` | One-shot per-node scaffolder. Deep-merges `integrations.routing.idea` + `integrations.providers.linear` into `.claude/ccanvil.local.json` and adds the `.gitignore` entries. Idempotent; safe to re-run to change providers. |

**Provider config:** `.claude/ccanvil.json` ships Linear provider defaults (mechanism, label, statuses). Each node opts in by setting `integrations.routing.idea = "linear"` and `integrations.providers.linear.{project, team}` in its own `.claude/ccanvil.local.json` — usually via `docs-check.sh idea-setup`. Unconfigured nodes use the local provider.

**Migration guide:** `.ccanvil/guide/ideas-migration.md` walks a downstream node through the full migration (pull → setup → Linear statuses → `idea-migrate` → smoke test).

## Radar Scripts

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `docs-check.sh radar-gather [docs-dir]` | Collect project state as JSON: active spec, completed specs, idea counts, roadmap theme, git activity, backlog |

## Manifest Verification Scripts

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `manifest-check.sh parse <readme>` | Parse markdown tables → JSON `[{path, description}]` |
| `manifest-check.sh check-existence <readme>` | Check which paths exist on disk, discover untracked files |
| `manifest-check.sh init <readme>` | Create `.claude/manifest.lock` with file hashes + git commit |
| `manifest-check.sh hash-check` | Compare current hashes against lockfile → verified/stale |
| `manifest-check.sh extract-identity <file>` | Extract identity metadata (comment headers, frontmatter, headings) |
| `manifest-check.sh check <readme>` | Full report: verified + stale (with diffs) + missing + untracked (with identity) |
| `manifest-check.sh verify <paths...>` | Update lockfile entries for confirmed paths |

## Stack Distribution Scripts

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `ccanvil-sync.sh stack-list` | List available stack profiles as JSON array `[{id, description, files}]` |
| `ccanvil-sync.sh stack-apply <stack-id>` | Apply a stack profile: copy files, merge CLAUDE.md section, merge settings.json hooks, update lockfile + ccanvil.json. Idempotent — re-running patches without clobbering |
| `ccanvil-sync.sh init-preflight <hub> --stack <id>` | Include stack files in init preflight plan |

## Docs Lifecycle Scripts

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `docs-check.sh status [docs-dir]` | Extract metadata (feature_id, hashes, timestamps) from spec/plan/stasis → JSON |
| `docs-check.sh validate [docs-dir]` | Check alignment: `aligned`, `stale-plan`, `stale-stasis`, `mismatched`, `unlinked`, `missing-determinism-review` |
| `docs-check.sh legacy-refs-scan [project-dir]` | Scan for legacy references (`/catchup`, `/checkpoint`, `docs/checkpoint.md`, etc.) → JSON. Scope: `hub-owned` vs `node-specific`. Exit 1 if any found |
| `docs-check.sh recommend [docs-dir]` | State machine → `{next_action, reason}` (e.g., "Run /plan", "Ready to build") |
| `docs-check.sh audit-session [--since commit] [repo-dir]` | Scan git diffs for stochastic patterns (cp, jq, shasum, git -C, curl, wget) + commit messages for indicator phrases → JSON |
